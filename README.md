# trainingautomation

Hi!

This repository was created with the objective of continuously adding personal projects regarding automation, which I create for the sake of learning.

So far this repository contains an automation framework built with Java + Selenium + TestNG using page object models. 

Additionally, I also added a bit of automated API testing using Java + RestAssured.
