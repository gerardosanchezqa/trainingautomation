# trainingautomation

Hi!

This repository was created with the objective of continuously adding personal projects regarding automation, which I create for the sake of learning.

So far this repository contains:
- An automation framework built with Java + Selenium + TestNG using page object models. 
- A bit of automated API testing using Java + RestAssured.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions regarding these side projects!
